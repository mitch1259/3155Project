Feature: Login

  The login feature allows the user to login and view/edit their 
  personal tasks/projects as well as access any additional options specific to their account.
  
  Example: User logs in.

Feature: View List

  The view list feature allows the user to see their list of tasks they have created in the application.
  These tasks are account-specific. If the user is authenticated successfully, they access the task list page, 
  and the task list loads successfully for that specific user,
  then they should be able to view their individual tasks on the application.
  Example: User opens the tasks list and the application displays their personal tasks.


Feature: Clock In/Out

  The user is signed in and wants to begin keeping track of their
  worked so that they can be compensated fairly. There is a button they
  can press so that they can clock in and out, which changes depending
  on their clock status.
  
  Example: Given a user is successfully logged in
           And they are on the clock in/out page of their account
           When they press the clock in/out button
           Then they have their timesheet updated

Feature: View Task

  The view task feature allows the user to (once logged in) click and 
  view a tasks name and details.

  Example: User clicks on a task from the task list to view the details of it.
