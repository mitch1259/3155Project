Feature: Login

  The login feature allows the user to login and view/edit their 
  personal tasks/projects as well as access any additional options specific to their account.
  
  Example: Given a user has filled in the login text boxes with their login credentials,
           When the user selects the login button,
           And the login credentials are correct,
           Then the system will log the user into their respective account.

Feature: View List

  The view list feature allows the user to see their list of tasks they have created in the application.
  These tasks are account-specific. If the user is authenticated successfully, they access the task list page, 
  and the task list loads successfully for that specific user,
  then they should be able to view their individual tasks on the application.
  
  Example: Given a user is signed in
           When the user selects to view their task list,
           Then they are displayed their list of tasks

Feature: Clock In/Out

  The user is signed in and wants to begin keeping track of their
  worked so that they can be compensated fairly. There is a button they
  can press so that they can clock in and out, which changes depending
  on their clock status.
  
  Example: Given a user is successfully logged in
           And they are on the clock in/out page of their account
           When they press the clock in/out button
           Then they have their timesheet updated

Feature: View Task

  The view task feature allows the user to (once logged in) click and 
  view a tasks name and details.

  Example: Given a user is viewing their task list,
           When the user selects on a certain task,
           And they are allowed to view that task,
           Then the system will show them the task and its details.
